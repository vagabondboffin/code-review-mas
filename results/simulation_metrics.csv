2,"**Feature Request: Backend Performance Optimization for Data Querying**

**Overview:**
The current data querying process exhibits latency issues, particularly with complex multi-table joins and large dataset retrievals. To enhance response time and ensure scalability, we propose implementing query optimization strategies and indexing improvements.

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Query Optimization:**
   - Implement query execution plans analysis using the database's native optimization tools (e.g., EXPLAIN in PostgreSQL) to identify and rectify inefficient joins and filter using appropriate methods","**Feature Request: Backend Performance Optimization for Data Querying**
