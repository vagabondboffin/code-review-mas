# AI-Agent Interaction Sandbox

A lightweight multi-agent system (MAS) sandbox for experimenting with AI agent behaviors, interactions, and alignment challenges in software engineering contexts.

## ðŸ§ª Project Purpose
- **Sandbox Environment**: Rapid prototyping of AI agent interactions
- **Behavior Analysis**: Collect and analyze traces of agent activities
- **Alignment Research**: Study misalignments in collaborative AI systems
- **PhD Foundation**: Extensible platform for multi-agent system research
